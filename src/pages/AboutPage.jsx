            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Here at Heavenly Crust Pizza, our passion extends beyond crafting the best-tasting thin crust pizza. Our journey began with a heartfelt mission. In 2019, our family participated in a mission trip to Lynch, Kentucky, a community striving to rebuild after the decline of the coal-mining industry. 
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              We were profoundly inspired by a Christian relief organization there that had established local businesses, including the Lamp House Coffee shop. The profits from these ventures were channeled directly back into the community, providing vital support and fostering hope. This model of business-as-mission resonated deeply with us.
